## Next Steps ðŸš§

### High Priority
1. **Database Migrations**
   - Create Drizzle migration files
   - Seed data for default roles and permissions

### Medium Priority
2. **Error Handling**
   - Enhance error types with specific error codes
   - Consistent error messages and logging

### Low Priority  
3. **Testing**
   - Unit tests for repositories
   - Integration tests for application services
   - Test utilities and fixtures

4. **Documentation**
   - API documentation
   - Usage examples
   - Architecture decision records

## Architecture Notes

### Hexagonal Architecture Implementation
- **Domain Layer**: Contains business logic, types, and port interfaces
- **Adapter Layer**: Contains concrete implementations for external services  
- **Application Layer**: Contains use cases and orchestrates domain logic

### Key Design Decisions
1. **Result Pattern**: Using `neverthrow` for explicit error handling
2. **Validation**: Zod schemas for runtime validation and type safety
3. **Database**: LibSQL with Drizzle ORM for type-safe queries
4. **Authentication**: Session-based with bcrypt password hashing
5. **Permissions**: Role-based access control (RBAC) system

### Current Status Summary
- **Foundation**: âœ… Solid foundation with schema, types, and ports
- **Data Layer**: âœ… Complete - all repository adapters implemented
- **Business Logic**: âœ… Complete - all 4 domains implemented (auth, user, team, okr)
- **Integration**: âœ… Complete - context and wiring implemented
