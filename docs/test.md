# Testing

- Create tests that validate formal method models
- Use `pnpm test` for tests
- Use `src/core/adapters/mock/${adapter}.ts` to create mock implementations of external services for testing

## Application Service Tests

- If needed, use `src/core/application/${domain}/${usecase}.test.ts` for unit tests of application services
